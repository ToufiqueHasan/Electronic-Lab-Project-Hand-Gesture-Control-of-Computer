# Hand Gesture Control of Computer
Hand Gesture Control of Computer is a combined project of both Hardware and software developed in Arduino and Python. 

# Features

# Implementation
Basicaly, I have used Distance and split it in some range for this purpose. To capture distance I have used two ULTRA SONIC SENSOR which helps me to measure accuratre 2D distance. Depends on this range I have tranfer singnal form Arduino to Python using Serial Communications to perform above discribed functionality.
